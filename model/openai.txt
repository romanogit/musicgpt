Analyzing...

- Your file contains 296 prompt-completion pairs
- Your data does not contain a common separator at the end of your prompts. Having a separator string appended to the end of the prompt makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should begin. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples. If you intend to do open-ended generation, then you should leave the prompts empty
- Your data does not contain a common ending at the end of your completions. Having a common ending string appended to the end of the completion makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should end. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples.
- The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details

Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
- [Recommended] Add a suffix separator ` ->` to all prompts [Y/n]: Y
- [Recommended] Add a suffix ending `\n` to all completions [Y/n]: Y
- [Recommended] Add a whitespace character to the beginning of the completion [Y/n]: Y


Your data will be written to a new JSONL file. Proceed [Y/n]: Y

Wrote modified file to `music_prepared (1).jsonl`
Feel free to take a look!

Now use that file when fine-tuning:
> openai api fine_tunes.create -t "music_prepared (1).jsonl"

After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string ` ->` for the model to start generating completions, rather than continuing with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=["\n"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 6.51 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
